                <p>One of the best thing about traveling is to explore new places. There are many ways of exploring a town. You can take a sightseeing bus, taxi, rent a car or even walk. The pros of taking a bus or driving is that you can get from A to B fast, but you miss out on a whole lot while your sitting behind a window. By walking you get fresh air, don't miss out on anything that passes you by, but you could get tired in your legs of walking a whole day, and it is'nt that fast either. There is a other option that combine both fast traveling, fresh air and exploring, Bicycling! </p>
                <p>Our goal here at Re-Cycle is to get more people to take a cycling tour instead of taking the bus or taxi. We want to help the enviorment and cycling is a good way to start helping. We have guided cycling tours around the world. So the next time your on vacation be sure to check if we have guided tours in that area.</p>
